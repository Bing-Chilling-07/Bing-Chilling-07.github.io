        <li><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Bing-Chilling-07/BCS_Stack_O_Matic" class = "pink-link">Stack-O-Matic</a></strong>: This was my first project in which I have learnt the basics of Reinforcement Learning and applied DQN.
        The project was done over the span of one month during winter under BCS club. Although this project might be slightly incomplete towards the end due to lack of time, I have still learnt a lot of new and interesting concepts in introductory Machine Learning.

        <li><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Bing-Chilling-07/SciMathSoc-Encrypting-Eqns" class = "pink-link">Encrypting Equations</a></strong>: This was my second project in which I have learnt the basics of Group theory, Rings, Fields, Elliptic curves and Encryption Algorithms.
          The project was done over the span of 3 months during summer under the SciMathSoc society, and we covered different algorithms like RSA, Diffie-Hellman, ELGamal, and their counterparts in Elliptic curve cryptography.
