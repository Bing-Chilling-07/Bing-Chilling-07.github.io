      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an undergrad studying physics at IIT-Kanpur. I like learning new things about the world around us from time to time, and I also like Math.
        I am primarily interested to do research in Mathematics and physics or anything that has a lot of problems to solve, I try not to be a specialist, but rather I try to learn concepts from
        every interesting topic that I encounter.
