      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an undergrad studying physics at IIT-Kanpur. I like learning new things about the world around us from time to time, and I also like Math.
        I am primarily interested to do research in Mathematics and physics or anything that has a lot of problems to solve, I try not to be a specialist, rather I try to learn concepts from
        every interesting topic that I encounter.

      <h2>Reading List (Books and Blogs)</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Brief History of time</strong>: Brief history of time was one of the first books that I have read, I came across this book in 8th grade from a biography about Stephen Hawking in my English Class.
            This book was one of the first few to convince me(along with Numberphile) to take physics for my higher studies.

            <strong>The Three Body Problem series(by Liu Cixin) </strong>: I came across the book series during my JEE prep, and found it to be really interesting. I did find it before the Netflix show :)
